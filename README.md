# Verifiable Credentials' WG new charter

This is the repository to create/update a charter for the [VC Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/). See the current draft at [Github io](https://w3c.github.io/vc-wg-charter/).

Current action: propose a charter extension, with the inclusion of a transfer to a maintenance WG once the Recommendations are published.
