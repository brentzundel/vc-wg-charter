The [current, official charter](https://www.w3.org/2022/06/verifiable-credentials-wg-charter.html) has been approved and announced on 2022-06-13. 

# Verifiable Credentials' WG new charter

This is the repository to create/update a charter for the [VC Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/). See the current draft at [Github io](https://w3c.github.io/vc-wg-charter/).

2024-03: The official charter is close to expiration. The Working Group is considering submitting a new charter, whose goals are twofold:

- Continue the work for cca. 6 months beyond the end of the current charter, to publish the set of Recommendations
- Once the Recommendations published, change the WG into a Maintenance WG.

If that charter development is indeed happening, the differences, compared to the 2022 version, can be seen [here](https://services.w3.org/htmldiff?doc1=https://www.w3.org/2022/06/verifiable-credentials-wg-charter.html&doc2=https://w3c.github.io/vc-wg-charter/).
